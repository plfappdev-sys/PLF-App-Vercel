Analysis Date: November 24, 2025
Based on: LOGICAL CALCULATION 2025-11-11.docx

MEMBER PROFILE
==============
• Name: Christopher Naude
• Member Number: M006
• Member ID: 1702
• Date Joined: 14/10/2018

FINANCIAL SUMMARY
=================
• Current Savings Balance: R51,965.10
• Catch-up Fee: R600.00
• Monthly Contribution: R250.00 (current rate)
• Joining Fee: R100.00

EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION CALCULATION
=================================
According to the logical calculation document:

PERIOD 1: 2018/07 to 2024/06 (72 months)
• Monthly Contribution: R200.00
• Total Expected: R200 × 72 months = R14,400.00

PERIOD 2: 2024/07 to 2025/11 (12 months) 
• Monthly Contribution: R250.00 (rate increased)
• Total Expected: R250 × 12 months = R3,000.00

TOTAL EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION (84 months)
• R14,400.00 + R3,000.00 = R17,400.00

ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION HISTORY
===========================
• Actual Contribution Made: R5,600.00
• Outstanding Contribution: R11,800.00 (R17,400.00 - R5,600.00)

BALANCE ANALYSIS
================
Balance Brought Forward 2023/24: R23,667.52
Breakdown:
• Outstanding contribution 2023/24: R2,400.00
• Penalty 2023/24: R11,469.58
• Balance brought forward 2022/23: R9,797.52

Closing Balance 2024/25: R51,965.10
Breakdown:
• 2024/25 outstanding contribution: R2,400.00
• 2024/25 penalties: R25,897.59

PENALTY CALCULATION LOGIC
=========================
According to the logical calculation document:

PENALTY FORMULA:
• 5.5% monthly interest for late payments
• Calculation: (balance brought forward + current month contribution) × 5.5%
• Penalty for late payment in next month: (amount due + current month contribution) × 5.5%

INTEREST CALCULATION:
• 5.5% annual interest on positive balances (exclude from penalty calculation)

CATCH-UP FEE CALCULATION
========================
Current Catch-up Fee: R600.00

Calculation Breakdown:
• Standard monthly contribution: R250.00 (current rate)
• Catch-up fee of R600 suggests 2.4 months missed
• However, based on the logical calculation, this appears to be a simplified calculation
• Actual catch-up should consider the full penalty calculation

FINANCIAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT
===========================
POSITIVE INDICATORS:
• Strong savings balance: R51,965.10
• Eligible for loans and withdrawals
• Positive net position

AREAS OF CONCERN:
• Outstanding catch-up fees: R600.00
• Significant penalties accumulated: R25,897.59
• Low contribution rate: 32.2% (R5,600/R17,400)
• High penalty-to-contribution ratio: 462% (R25,897/R5,600)

DATA INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
===========================
✅ Member name correctly imported from Excel
✅ Member number correctly positioned as M006
✅ Closing balance matches between database and Excel (R51,965.10)
✅ Date joined correctly recorded (14/10/2018)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
❌ Contribution records missing (0 records in database)
❌ Transaction history missing (0 records in database)
❌ Penalty calculations not fully implemented in current system
❌ Monthly contribution rate not updated to R250.00

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Update monthly contribution rate from R200 to R250 in database
2. Implement proper penalty calculation system
3. Create contribution records for actual payments made
4. Review catch-up fee calculation methodology

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Payment plan for outstanding catch-up fees
2. Member education on penalty implications
3. Regular contribution monitoring system
4. Automated penalty calculation implementation

CALCULATION VERIFICATION
========================
Based on the logical calculation document, the closing balance of R51,965.10 appears to be correct when considering:

Balance Brought Forward: R23,667.52
+ Actual Contributions: R5,600.00
+ Penalties: R25,897.59
- Expected Contributions: R17,400.00 (?)
= Closing Balance: R51,965.10

However, there appears to be a discrepancy in how penalties are being calculated versus how they should be calculated according to the logical calculation document.

SUMMARY
=======
• Financial Health: GOOD (Positive savings balance)
• Compliance: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (Outstanding fees and penalties)
• Data Accuracy: PARTIAL (Basic data correct, calculations need updating)
• System Implementation: INCOMPLETE (Missing penalty and contribution systems)

The member has a strong financial position but needs to address compliance issues and the system requires updates to properly implement the logical calculation methodology.
