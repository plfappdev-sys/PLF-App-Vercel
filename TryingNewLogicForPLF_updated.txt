# PLF New Business Logic Implementation Plan
## Created: September 19, 2025
## Updated: September 21, 2025
## Based on Analysis of NewBusLogic Requirements

## OVERVIEW
This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for integrating the new business logic into the existing PLF application without breaking current functionality.

## CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT
✅ Supabase integration complete with authentication
✅ Member management with 89 imported members (updated from Excel)  
✅ Loan application and approval workflows
✅ Interest calculation engine with daily compounding
✅ Comprehensive reporting system with PDF generation
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Database schema with users, members, transactions, loans, interest_accruals
✅ Historical data migration completed with catch-up fees

## NEW REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
The new business logic requires implementation of:
1. R200 monthly contributions with due dates
2. Catch-up fees for new members joining after July 2018
3. 7% late fees applied on the 8th of each month
4. Variable savings interest rates (configurable by admins)
5. 20% standard loan interest with 40% penalty after 90 days
6. New database tables: contributions, member_balances, financial_years, system_settings, audit_logs
7. Scheduled functions for daily/monthly processing
